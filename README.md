# Digital Business Card 

A React project created in the Scrimba Frontend Development Career Path. 

This project makes use of Tailwind CSS with React Components styled largely to the figma design provided by the Scrimba Course.

-------------------
This was created using the template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
